## About

A normal toggle switch in html have only two states. But two is not enough for me, so i made three.

You can add different functionalities based on the state of this toggle switch.

In this example, the code allow users to change the background color of a webpage using the tri-state toggle switch.

This code is based on simple html, css and javascript.
